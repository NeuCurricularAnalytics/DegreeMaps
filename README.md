# School Curriculum Complexity Maps and Notes

The following should contain a folder for each
school reviewed. Let's not forget to add notes.

This file will be updated with lists, and who is working on the review

## Templates    
* [DegreePlanTemplate.csv] - Do not edit, but copy over. It is the format required for [Curricular Analytics](https://curricularanalytics.github.io/CurricularAnalytics.jl/latest/persistence.html)
* Each university should have its own folder, with a README.md detailing extra information about the plans. 


## Using https://www.curricularanalytics.org

[https://www.curricularanalytics.org/](https://www.curricularanalytics.org/) is the migration from the github tool. Created an organization on there. Copies of the spreadsheets are kept in this repo.
