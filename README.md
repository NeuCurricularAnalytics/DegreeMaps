# School Curriculum Complexity Maps and Notes

Degree / Curricular maps created for various CS departments for research. Public repository of degree maps, as school maps are public. These are one pathway through the curriculum, and are not the only way to complete the degree. This is not completely, it just includes
schools as we add them. [https://www.curricularanalytics.org/](https://www.curricularanalytics.org/) has more programs as various schools can add and make their degrees public.


## Templates
